# Data-Encryption-using-AES
 
Data is a most important part of our lives. It’s the root of knowledge. But some data in wrong hand can be very dangerous for us. That’s why data security is compulsory. Sometime we need to transfer confidential data through the internet. But internet in full of hackers and eavesdropper.  In that case, the best way to secure data is Cryptography. Cryptography is the way to hide information by encryption and decoding it by decryption. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, also known as the Rijndael algorithm is a symmetrical block cipher cryptographic algorithm that takes plain text and converts them to unreadable format known as cipher text using keys. The cipher text can be converted back to plain text through the process of decryption using same keys. AES encryption used in a lot of ways, including wireless security, processor security, image encryption, file encryption. The NSA (National Security Agency) United States Department of Defence they are using AES to encrypt Top Secret information. So that’s why AES has gained the confidence of various industries. Since the AES algorithm is considered secure, it is in the worldwide standard. In this paper, we will implement AES in Python to encrypt and decrypt any file including text messages, images, voice messages, pdf, documents and any other file formats.
